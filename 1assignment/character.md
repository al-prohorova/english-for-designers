## Character & Description

For our first assignment, I chose a picture from my archive. It shows a letter T made of wood, which is also a Tau cross. Its shape comes from the Greek letter tau and it is associated with the Franciscan order and pilgrims. We found it in a monastery in Rome, and my mom now wears it proudly as a pilgrim.
