## Character & Description

For out first assignment I found a picture from my archive. It's a letter T made from wood, but also Tau cross because it is shaped like the Greek letter tau and is associated with the Franciscan order and piligrims. We found it in a monastery in Rome. My mom now wears it like a proud pilgrim.
